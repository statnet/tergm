\description{
The Persistence Operator Term
}
\details{
This term accepts a model formula
and produces the corresponding model for the
post-dissolution/persistence network: effectively the network containing
ties that persisted since the last time step.

This is the equivalent of the old-style \code{dissolution} model. So
a larger positive coefficient for \code{Persist()} operator means
less dissolution. It
produces the same results as the new \code{Diss()} operator, except the
signs of the coefficients are negated.
