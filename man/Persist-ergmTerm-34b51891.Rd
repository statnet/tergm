\arguments{
\item{formula}{a one-sided \code{\link[ergm:ergm]{ergm()}}-style formula with the terms to be evaluated}

\item{lm, subset, weights, contrasts, offset, label}{\strong{\code{\link[=NetSeries]{NetSeries()}} LHS only} arguments to specify time-varying parameters. See \code{\link[ergm.multi:N-ergmTerm-c9b59cc1]{N()}} term operator in the \pkg{ergm.multi} for details. \code{lm} formula may reference \code{.Time} for the network's time index, \code{.TimeID} for the its index in the network series (where the initial network is 1 and the first modelled network is 2), and \code{.TimeDelta} for the time elapsed between the network and the immediately previous network in the series.}

\description{
The Persistence Operator Term
}
\details{
This term accepts a model formula
and produces the corresponding model for the
post-dissolution/persistence network: effectively the network containing
ties that persisted since the last time step.

This is the equivalent of the old-style \code{dissolution} model. So
a larger positive coefficient for \code{Persist()} operator means
less dissolution. It
produces the same results as the new \code{Diss()} operator, except the
signs of the coefficients are negated.
