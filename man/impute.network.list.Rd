\usage{
impute.network.list(
  nwl,
  imputers = c(),
  nwl.prepend = list(),
  nwl.append = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nwl}{A list of \code{\link[network:network]{network}} objects or a
\code{\link[ergm:network.list]{network.list}} object.}

\item{imputers}{A character vector giving one or more methods to
impute missing dyads. Currenly implemented methods are as
follows: \describe{ \item{\code{next}}{Impute the state of the same
dyad in the next network in the list (or later, if that one is
also missing).  This imputation method is likely to lead to an
underestimation of the tie-change rates. The last
network in the list cannot be imputed this way.}
\item{\code{previous}}{Impute the state of the same dyad in
the previous network in the list (or earlier, if that one is also
missing). The first network in the list cannot be imputed this
way.}  \item{\code{majority}}{Impute the missing dyad with
the value of the majority among the non-missing dyads in that
time step's network. A network that has exactly the same number
of ties as non-missing non-ties cannot be imputed this way.}
\item{\code{0}}{Assume missing dyads are all non-ties.}
\item{\code{1}}{Assume missing dyads are all ties.} } If
\code{length(imputers)>1} the specified imputation methods will
be applied in succession. For example,
\code{imputers=c("next","previous","majority","0")} would first
try to impute a missing dyad with the next time step's value. If
it, and all of the later values for that dyad are missing, it
will try to impute it with the previous time step's value. If it,
and all of the earlier values for that dyad are missing as well,
it will try to impute it with the value of the majority of
non-missing dyads for that time step. If there is an exact tie,
it will impute 0.}

\item{nwl.prepend}{An optional list of networks to treat as
preceding those in \code{nwl}. They will not be imputed or
returned, but they can be useful for imputing dyads in the first
network in \code{nwl}, when using \code{"previous"} imputer.}

\item{nwl.append}{An optional list of networks to treat as
following those in \code{nwl}. They will not be imputed or
returned, but they can be useful for imputing dyads in the last
network in \code{nwl}, when using \code{"next"} imputer.}
}
\value{
A list of networks with missing dyads imputed.
}
\description{
This function takes a list of networks with missing dyads and returns a list
of networks with missing dyads imputed according to a list of imputation
directives.
